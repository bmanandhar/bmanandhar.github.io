I have always been a sincere and hard worker in any field that I worked in. For a long period of time, I helped students by tutoring the subject of math with great patience in order to get them pas the High School. I also helped students of a community college at the learning center. I was a successful physics teacher when I lived in a different country in the past.

I found myself always driven toward computer software since the time at the university and started learning programming languages and other technologies required to become a developer, developed several projects by writing front-end and back-end codebases to successfully access, process and render data using public API libraries.

Now, I am a well-versed and fully equipped developer and can assure that any company that hires me will surely rip the fruit that my experience and knowledge together will bring.
